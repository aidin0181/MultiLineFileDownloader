# MultiLineFileDownloader

Hi, This is a simple http downloader.
you can download files via pasting link in it.

the main difference from other downloaders is that it uses all yor internet available network interfaces.
so, it gives you a faster speed for downloading.  
for testing just use a usb hub and plug your 4G connections to the hub and enable usb internet sharing from your device.  
for better performance, it is better that all connections are of the same type. (for example: all connections are 4G or 3G or Ethernet)

features:

1- download files with extentions (example x.com/file.exe).it can't download a redirect link for now)  
2- pause / resume , if the web server doesn't support pause/resume, it won't download

i'm gonna add all other features.but since i'm using a pure socket for connecting to servers , it'll take a little bit more time.  
i'll be glad to see you uploading images of improving your download.


Hope you Enjoy it.
